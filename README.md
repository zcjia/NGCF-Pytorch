# NGCF-Pytorch
Pytorch implementation of NGCF

This is a pytorch version of NGCF(Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering).

# Environment Requirement
The code has been tested under python 3.7.6. The required packages are as follows:
* pytorch == 1.0.0
* numpy == 1.18.1
* scipy == 1.4.1

The result is:
